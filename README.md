Interactable tree displaying chess positions <br>
  Drag and drop pieces to make a line <br>

  ***As of now you can't take pieces as well as some other moves, this is purely a test for the tree representation system <br>
To run:
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code
  3. Start an http server (enter http-server in a new terminal) <br>
