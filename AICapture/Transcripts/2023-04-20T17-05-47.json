{"Time":"1682108810","Type":"Response","Text":"It looks like you're trying to use ES6 `export` syntax, which is not supported in all JavaScript environments. If you're running your code in a browser that doesn't support ES6 modules, you'll need to use a different syntax for exporting your class.\n\nOne option is to use CommonJS-style exports instead:\n\n```\nclass uiHelpers {\n  // ...\n}\n\nmodule.exports = uiHelpers;\n```\n\nThen, in your other file, you can import it like this:\n\n```\nconst uiHelpers = require('./ui-helpers');\n```\n\nIf you want to use the newer syntax, you can either run your code through a bundler like Webpack or Babel, or you can change your script type to \"module\" and use the newer syntax directly in your HTML file:\n\n```\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import { uiHelpers } from './ui-helpers.js';\n  // ...\n</script>\n```","ParentMessageId":"fb833bdc-d727-4f44-9046-04f23cb31ebf","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
